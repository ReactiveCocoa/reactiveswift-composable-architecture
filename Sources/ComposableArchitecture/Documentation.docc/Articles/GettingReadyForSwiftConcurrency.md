# Getting ready for Swift concurrency

Learn how to write safe, concurrent effects using Swift's structured concurrency.

As of version 5.6, Swift can provide many warnings for situations in which you might be using types
and functions that are not thread-safe in concurrent contexts. Many of these warnings can be ignored
for the time being, but in Swift 6 most (if not all) of these warnings will become errors, and so
you will need to know how to prove to the compiler that your types are safe to use concurrently.

There are 3 primary ways to create an ``Effect`` in the library:

  * ``Effect/task(priority:operation:catch:file:fileID:line:)``
  * ``Effect/run(priority:operation:catch:file:fileID:line:)``
  * ``Effect/fireAndForget(priority:_:)``

Each of these constructors takes a `@Sendable`, asynchronous closure, which restricts the types of
closures you can use for your effects. In particular, the closure can only capture `Sendable`
variables that are bound with `let`. Mutable variables and non-`Sendable` types are simply not
allowed to be passed to `@Sendable` closures.

There are two primary ways you will run into this restriction when building a feature in the
Composable Architecture: accessing state from within an effect, and accessing a dependency from
within an effect.

### Accessing state in an effect

Reducers are executed with a mutable, `inout` state variable, and such variables cannot be accessed
from within `@Sendable` closures:

```swift
Reducer { state, action, environment in 
  switch action {
  case .buttonTapped:
    return .task {
      try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: NSEC_PER_SEC)
      return .delayed(state.count) 
      // 🛑 Mutable capture of 'inout' parameter 'state' is 
      //    not allowed in concurrently-executing code
    }

    …
  }
}
```

To work around this you must explicitly capture the state as an immutable value for the scope of the
closure:

```swift
return .task { [state] in 
  try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: NSEC_PER_SEC)
  return .delayed(state.count) // ✅
}
```

You can also capture just the minimal parts of the state you need for the effect by binding a new
variable name for the capture:

```swift
return .task { [count = state.count] in 
  try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: NSEC_PER_SEC)
  return .delayed(count) // ✅
}
```

### Accessing dependencies in an effect

In the Composable Architecture, one designs an environment of dependencies that your feature needs to
do its job. These are all the clients and objects that interact with the messy, unpredictable
outside world, but provide an interface that is easy to control so that we can still write tests.

Dependencies are typically accessed inside the effect, which means it must be `Sendable`, otherwise
we will get the following warning (and error in Swift 6):

```swift
case .numberFactButtonTapped:
  return .task { [count = state.count] in
    await .numberFactResponse(
      TaskResult { try await environment.factClient.fetch(count) }
    )
    // ⚠️ Capture of 'environment' with non-sendable type 'AppEnvironment' 
    //    in a `@Sendable` closure
  }
```

To fix this we need to make each dependency held in the environment `Sendable`. This usually just
means making sure that the interface type only holds onto `Sendable` data, and in particular, any
closure-based endpoints should be annotated as `@Sendable`:

```swift
struct FactClient {
  var fetch: @Sendable (Int) async throws -> String
}
```

This will restrict the kinds of closures that can be used when construct `FactClient` values, thus 
making the entire `FactClient` sendable itself.
