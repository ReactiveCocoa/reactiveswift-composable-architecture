/// A ``ViewStore`` is an object that can observe state changes and send actions. They are most
/// commonly used in views, such as SwiftUI views, UIView or UIViewController, but they can be
/// used anywhere it makes sense to observe state and send actions.
///
/// In SwiftUI applications, a ``ViewStore`` is accessed most commonly using the ``WithViewStore``
/// view. It can be initialized with a store and a closure that is handed a view store and must
/// return a view to be rendered:
///
/// ```swift
/// var body: some View {
///   WithViewStore(self.store) { viewStore in
///     VStack {
///       Text("Current count: \(viewStore.count)")
///       Button("Increment") { viewStore.send(.incrementButtonTapped) }
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In UIKit applications a ``ViewStore`` can be created from a ``Store`` and then subscribed to for
/// state updates:
///
/// ```swift
/// let store: Store<State, Action>
/// let viewStore: ViewStore<State, Action>
///
/// init(store: Store<State, Action>) {
///   self.store = store
///   self.viewStore = ViewStore(store)
/// }
///
/// func viewDidLoad() {
///   super.viewDidLoad()
///
///       self.viewStore.produced.count
///         .startWithValues { [weak self] in self?.countLabel.text = $0 }
/// }
///
/// @objc func incrementButtonTapped() {
///   self.viewStore.send(.incrementButtonTapped)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Thread safety
///
/// The ``ViewStore`` class is not thread-safe, and all interactions with it (and the store it was
/// derived from) must happen on the same thread. Further, for SwiftUI applications, all
/// interactions must happen on the _main_ thread. See the documentation of the ``Store`` class for
/// more information as to why this decision was made.
///
/// ### ViewStore object lifetime
///
/// You must always keep a strong reference to any ``ViewStore`` that you create to prevent it from
/// being immediately deallocated, and thereby preventing its ``produced`` ``StoreProducer`` from
/// emiting any more state updates. This is primarly an issue when using UIKit, as the SwiftUI
/// ``WithViewStore`` helper ensures that the ``ViewStore`` is retained.
